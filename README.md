# python_vnc_demo

This is the code to support the blog post [Interactive GUIs for Containerized Applications](https://www.gradman.com/blog/interactive-guis-for-containerized-applications-without-html/)

Clone this repository, run `docker-compose up --build` and visit `http://localhost:6080/vnc.html`

A notable difference between this repo and its description in the blog post is that I have not included an nginx proxy here.
